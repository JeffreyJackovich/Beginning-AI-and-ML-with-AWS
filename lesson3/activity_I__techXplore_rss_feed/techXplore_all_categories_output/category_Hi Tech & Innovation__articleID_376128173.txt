A Japanese company called QD Laser in collaboration with the University of Tokyo has developed a pair of glasses that come with a tiny camera that captures data and a laser that prints imagery from the camera directly onto the retina. The glasses are still in the prototype stage but researchers with the project gave a demonstration in Osaka last week at the 1st Medical IT Solutions Expo of Medical Japan, indicating that they do work at least to some extent.
