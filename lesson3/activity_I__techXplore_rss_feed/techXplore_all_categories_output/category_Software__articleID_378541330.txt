The Justice Department has managed to unlock an iPhone 5c used by the gunman Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last December. The high-profile case has pitted federal law enforcement agencies against Apple, which fought a legal order to work around its passcode security feature to give law enforcement access to the phone's data. The FBI said it relied on a third party to crack the phone's encrypted data, raising questions about iPhone security and whether federal agencies should disclose their method.
