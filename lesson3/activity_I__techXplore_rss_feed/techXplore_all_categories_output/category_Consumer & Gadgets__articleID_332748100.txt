A new project on Kickstarter has gotten a lot of attention, it's the KEECKER, billed as The World's First HomePod, a rolling egg-looking robot that moves from room to room in a person's house, bringing personal entertainment functionality with it. The idea is that instead of having music players, television sets, etc. in multiple rooms, have just one that can be summoned to wherever you want.
