(Tech Xplore)—A new startup based in Paris, France has created a service called Virtuo that allows customers to rent a car without having to visit a rental office—instead, they can do everything they need to do to rent a car by using an app on their smartphone. But, the catch is that the app does not work with existing car rental companies, such as Hertz, Avis, etc., instead the company has their own fleet of vehicles—all of which are diesel Mercedes A-Class cars.
