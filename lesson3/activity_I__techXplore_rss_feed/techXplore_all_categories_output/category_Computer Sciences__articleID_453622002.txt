Researchers at the University of Tartu's Computational Neuroscience Lab, in Estonia, have discovered that activations of deep convolutional neural networks are aligned with the gamma band activity of the human visual cortex. Their study, published in Communications Biology, further highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to broaden understanding of the human brain.
