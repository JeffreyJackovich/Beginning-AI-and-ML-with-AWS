A team of researchers at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has developed a type of soft robot that can generate signals without using electricity. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe their study of origami objects and their possible use as signaling devices and possibly as logic gates.
