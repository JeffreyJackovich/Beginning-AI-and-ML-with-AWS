A small team of researchers at UC Berkeley has used neural-networking software to create a program that copies the dance moves of one person to anotherâ€”making it look like the second person is doing the dancing. The team, with members Caroline Chan, Shiry Ginosar, Tinghui Zhou and Alexei Efros, has written a paper describing their software and has posted it on the arXiv preprint server.
