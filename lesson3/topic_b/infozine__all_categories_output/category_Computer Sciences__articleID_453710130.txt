Physicians currently spend a lot of time writing notes about patients and inserting them into electronic health record (EHR) systems. According to a 2016 study, doctors spend approximately two hours on administrative work for every hour spent with a patient. Thanks to cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools, this note-writing process could soon become automated, helping doctors to better manage their shifts and relieving them from this tedious task.
