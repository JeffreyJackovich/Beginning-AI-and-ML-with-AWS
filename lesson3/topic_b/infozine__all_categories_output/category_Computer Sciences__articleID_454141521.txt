A team of researchers at North Carolina State University has recently carried out an empirical analysis of the executable status of Python code snippets shared on GitHub. Their study, pre-published on arXiv, also presents Gistable, a new database of executable Python code snippets on GitHub's gist system, which could enable reproducible studies in the field of software engineering.
