Primer's John Bohannon has been discovering people's work and contributions thanks to a machine learning system built at Primer. "It does this much as a human would, if a human could read 500 million news articles, 39 million scientific papers, all of Wikipedia, and then write 70,000 biographical summaries of scientists." The reason this is news is because you would probably never know about their contributions by frequenting Wikipedia, but he knows a way to fix that.
