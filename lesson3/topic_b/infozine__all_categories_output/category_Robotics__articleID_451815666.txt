A pair of researchers at Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International in Japan has developed a brain-machine interface (BMI) to manipulate a robotic arm while the subject's hands engage in a different activity. In their paper published in the journal Science Robotics, Christian Penaloza and Shuichi Nishio describe their system and how well it worked when tested with volunteers.
