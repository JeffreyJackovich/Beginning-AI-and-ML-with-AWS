Ara Project lead Paul Eremenko had news about where Ara is headed this week at the second Ara Developer Conference in Cupertino, California. Puerto Rico is the first key stop. Google is to test its build-it-yourself smartphone in Puerto Rico before any global launch is announced. The pilot will kick off later this year in partnership with carriers OpenMobile and Claro. Consumers with enough enthusiasm to mix-and-match phone parts will be able to take advantage of what the Ara enthusiasts call a "modular hardware ecosystem." The Ara premise is to satisfy and provide an alternative to such questions as, why feel stuck with your handset hardware design and its parts? What if you could pick the camera you want for your phone rather than picking your phone for the camera? What if you could choose a camera from one manufacturer, a display from another, until you get the phone you want?
