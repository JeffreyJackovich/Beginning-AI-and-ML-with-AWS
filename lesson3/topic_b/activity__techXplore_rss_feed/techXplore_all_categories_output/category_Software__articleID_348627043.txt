Can, did, Cortana work on Android? A talked-about act at droidcon 2015: a presentation titled "Cracking Cortana." The OrangeSec team arrived at the Turin, Italy, event to show their work in a CortanaProxy server for intercepting Cortana requests (Windows Phone 8.1). TechWorm on Saturday reported that the Italy-based hacker team said to have brought Microsoft's Cortana to Android. That's rather spectacular because Microsoft has not yet brought Cortana to Android. Microsoft is expected to do so some time later on.
