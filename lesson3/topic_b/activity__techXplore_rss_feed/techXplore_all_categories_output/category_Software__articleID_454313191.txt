Researchers at UC Davis have recently developed a new machine learning based tool to verify multimedia rumors online. Their paper, pre-published on arXiv, proposes cross-lingual and cross-platform features for rumor verification, which leverage the semantic similarity between rumors and information on other websites. Their method can combine information from multiple languages to get a complete picture of online news.
