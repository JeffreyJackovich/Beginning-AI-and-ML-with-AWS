Researchers at Chinese multinational tech company Baidu have recently developed a data-driven auto-tuning framework for self-driving vehicles based on the Apollo autonomous driving platform. The framework, presented in a paper pre-published on arXiv, consists of a new reinforcement learning algorithm and an offline training strategy, as well as an automatic method of collecting and labelling data.
