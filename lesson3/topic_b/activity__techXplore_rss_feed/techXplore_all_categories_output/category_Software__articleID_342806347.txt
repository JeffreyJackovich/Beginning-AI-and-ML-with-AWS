Goodbye SPDY. The official Chromium blog from Chris Bentzel, Multiplexing Manager and Bence BÃ©ky, HTTP/2 Enabler, said on Monday they are saying goodbye to SPDY, the open nonstandard protocol that they were using. Chrome supported SPDY since Chrome 6, but now the plan is to remove support for SPDY in early 2016. They will also remove support for a TLS extension named NPN. (TLS stands for Transport Layer Security extension. NPN stands for Next Protocol Negotiation, which "allows application level protocols to be  negotiated without additional round trips and with clean fallback in the case of an unsupportive MITM proxy.")
