Researchers from Chongqing University, in China, have recently developed a self-powered triboelectric auditory sensor (TAS) that could be used to build electronic auditory systems for external hearing aids in intelligent robotics applications. Their recent study, published in Science Robotics, could inform the creation of a new generation of auditory systems, addressing some of the key challenges in the field of social robotics.
